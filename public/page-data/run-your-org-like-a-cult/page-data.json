I hate it when I fall behind..</p>\n<p>But, with family matters, moving, or new projects…</p>\n<p>And wildfires, global warming, the war in Ukraine and more, I bet you didn’t even notice.</p>\n<p>Especially if you run a team or a small business. We’re living in turbulent times.</p>\n<p>The Great Resignation has warped the way owners operate. Its frustrating out there.</p>\n<p>Are you having trouble keeping up with customer demand?</p>\n<p>Obviously, that’s not a bad problem to have as long as you got the people to maintain.</p>\n<p>But it sucks not being able to really scale or compete as well, right?</p>\n<p>Listen, I get it.</p>\n<p>There’s only so much you and your team can do at the moment.</p>\n<p>Or, so you BELIEVE.</p>\n<p>But, what if I told you about how to catalyze your organizations’ growth in a way that you’ll never find in a book or a seminar or YouTube video?</p>\n<p>Sound too good to be true?</p>\n<p>Allow me pull back the curtain for you.</p>\n<p>Today’s post is about creating beliefs and managing them for the purpose of propelling your leadership.</p>\n<p>We’re going to talk about running your business LIKE a CULT.</p>\n<p>Wait, what?</p>\n<p>No, I’m not talking about all the evil stuff that comes to mind.</p>\n<p>The word cult gets a bad rap. It’s just short for culture.</p>\n<p>If you’re a Red Sox fan, you’re in a cult whether you know it or not.</p>\n<p>One that believes the Yankees suck whether this is true or not.</p>\n<p>Big brands have long mastered being cultural because without this phenomenon, they fade, they die.</p>\n<p>So what does this have to do with you?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Even if you’re only a Contractor with ten guys or managing an office somewhere (at home virtually, lol) I want to break down the 3 pillars to how organizations behave to achieve cult-like power so that you may apply these principals for your own gain al a carte.</p>\n<p>These work for big business and they will work for you. How else do you think Starbucks became so?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here, I’ve broken it down to A.B.C.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alignment!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s talk about Crisis.</p>\n<p>Most managers and leaders obviously avoid crisis and end up sucking at dealing with it.</p>\n<p>When you can spin a crisis or a breakdown as an opportunity for others you plug people into a higher sense of purpose without any further effort.</p>\n<p>This is the GOLD, people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Belonging!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond money, people are motivated to increase their own value. How much they make, how much their worth, etc.</p>\n<p>So make your organization a growth academy under the hood and people will never leave because they are plugging into their potential.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cult like organizations use these two pillars above in a variety of ways that’s held together by the art of communicating.</p>\n<p>They use compassion and language at the same time, in action. In short, they make their people feel loved and get rid of the bullshit. Get rid of the drama. Get to the truth as a whole.</p>\n<p>And most importantly, this is where everything circles back to Alignment. They use communication techniques to agitate people with the crisis.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This all make sense?</p>\n<p>Now, imagine all this for a minute or two.</p>\n<p>A company that feels like family. A relaxed, focused bunch of people who love what they do everyday.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t have to be a fantasy.</p>\n<p>The trouble for most is that it’s impossible to get what I’m putting down here on Amazon or Youtube. So most leaders end up trying small slivers of advanced techniques on their own, fail, then give up.</p>\n<p>Don’t be a lone wolf leader stuck in a bad dream.</p>\n<p>Become a Honeymkr Member today!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Run Your Org like a Cult","date":"January 25, 2022","description":"How to keep people plugged in and inspired in the work place."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/The Rabbit Hole/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Down the Rabbit Hole"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"ccaa7631-1ae0-5723-8474-9d0dc38458c1","previousPostId":"90077755-a98d-508b-b425-8abbd9508eab","nextPostId":null}},
