We spent hours working together and talking about a whole bunch of things. Realized we had in common. One of the most remarkable things about our conversation was that my friend shared that he is committed to attaining enlightenment, which really made me pause because you never really hear that around Northeast Kingdom of Vermont</p>\n<p>At any rate, I found myself sharing tons of insights with my friend as we coerced through what is ego. What is consciousness? We also talked about various depths of experience under the influence of psychedelics and how that experience leads to the back door of a lot of quantum physics style realizations of late and also mirroring the myth of the bardos from Tibetan religion.</p>\n<p>My favorite part of the conversation is when I started talking about ego and for the past 10 years I’ve been working rigorously on myself to transform and in this search and the work that I’ve done through trainings and just self-taught discoveries. Is that self and ego are very much collapsed in everyday language so that people don’t realize at all how much ego is running their life. It’s running the show. They have no way to test for it. No way to look for it’s not even talked about. Not seriously and it’s funny because after realizing this for myself I began practicing. You know to watch my language. Every time I say something I’m hungry. I’m bored whatever the eye is, just a mapping for ego. So instead of I’m driving when I’m saying is Jason through ego lens is driving and there is simple detachment from reality that happens every single time we speak without being able to discern with real distinction, the nature of our words and how we show up in speaking them. So this is kind of kooky stuff and interesting. But I cited in the one this conversation with my friend about how it was a joke to me that my ex-wife has on her Facebook profile a mastery of self like that’s her thing and me knowing her quite well and knowing how actually very selfish she is. It’s a knee slapper.  Honestly, I couldn’t help but confide with my new friend that I’d recently profiled her as a narcissist oblivious and ignorant to the impacts of her very selfish actions.</p>\n<p>So getting back on track. Having this conversation with my friend, he gave me a pause cuz here I am spitting out insights and maybe five or six years older than this dude. And he’s like I’m out to you know discovered enlightenment being lightened and in the situation. This conversation I felt like you know. Oh I’m you know like a little bit more of a hot shot. Let me say something. You know I felt responsible to come up with an not even an answer, but maybe a question to a young person who is interested and enlightenment like for themselves. That’s pretty bold actually. I can’t help but take it seriously. So what I said to him was simply look for it in language. Watch your language. That’s a good place. That’s been a place that’s been fruitful for me to discover how I am being and how others are being.</p>\n<p>Ontology is a pretty new thing to me in the last 3 or 4 years. I’ve been getting my head wrapped around it so to speak and in my own journey to discover like what is enlightenment. Can I be enlightened? I’ve noticed a lot of it has been from a very ego-driven point of view or identity or it’s my ego seeking to be enlightened so that it doesn’t have to do anything. And I think that’s the funny thing about ego. It’s such a lazy. It laysifies things and it’s laziness and ego. You know things that are that come from ego or reaction states states of being angry, states of being upset or sad or malignant   matters stemming from the ego nature tend to be of conflict and drama and our cell center never observous and this really marks a distinction about discovering or listening for ego</p>\n<p>If you don’t mind me speaking, I would like to heavily suppose that being enlightened may really translate as being completely aware and connected living through ego primarily or heavily results in the opposite of this. As an experience of life, things seem huge but I mean small because you end up living small living disconnected even as a wealthy person. Whereas being of service is being selfless taking care of others, other cells, other egos</p>\n<p>And the result of living this way I heavily surmise leads to being light and easy and love happy at ease, patient, extremely compassionate and understanding. So I mean, doesn’t that actually sound like enlightenment when we think of the corny idea of it Buddha and etc</p>\n<p>Another common misunderstood thing about being enlightened if you ask me or my ego hahaha. Is that you’re somehow trying to get rid of your ego or kill it? That’s a sort of thing you hear around conversations with psychedelics. It’s that LSD or other psychedelics have an ego diminishing quality to it and there’s a conversation there about boundary dissolving or boundary diminishing experience under the influence of psychedelics that leads you to being more egoless but the misunderstanding I think across the borders that we get rid of our ego and if you ask mine again, my ego is going to tell you that it’s discovered that you can’t get rid of it, obviously. And in fact, the truth is that transforming ego is the form of being enlightened. If besides the words I’m speaking, there’s integrity. There’s an intentional momentum to being enlightened to being transformative and constantly transformed</p>\n<p>It may be amateur of me were unfair of me to say some of this stuff but it’s what I got.   After reading tons of books and being a part of seminars and meeting other intelligent beings, I’ve personally and now just on a pathless path where I don’t subscribe to being a part of another ideology or another group or another master class or community because I’m done being a consumer of transformation. Now it’s a responsibility of mine and apparently my ego. Hahaha that I cause transformation as a gateway to being enlightened of causing something substantial to happen and this is where I usually share a little antidote from a book or two that I’ve read that I found useful. One is Lauren Isley’s. Essay on plants is a brilliant anthropologist who wrote in a kind of style that was accessible for people to read, right? And the essay is all about how you know millions and millions and millions of years ago plants didn’t have flowers, so in fact plants had one way of having sex just to be simple and it wasn’t enough or well. Let’s say they’re being connected and they’re being highly aware constantly somehow in your rising of intelligence, these plants invented flowers so suddenly from outer space. Looking at the planet suddenly right? It’s just a green globe with a whole bunch of blue on it and then the green suddenly starts to change colors once in a while all the time etc. But the point is that being enlightened may be the key to all invention or creativity and the same. And I mean this in the kind of higher dimension of like this is the universe at work right now and this is how to be absolutely one with the universe.</p>\n<p>This stuff gets pretty meta the more you talk about it. But if there’s one takeaway I would like my readers have is to watch your language. Look at how you listen to things and four things and look at language as your access to your being.</p>\n<p>I love hearing from my people, so if you have any questions or would like to share any of your own insights around this topic of ego and  enlightenment.
