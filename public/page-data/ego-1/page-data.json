Is the ego or the self? And the evidence for this is pretty simple. If you pay attention to how many times a day you refer to yourself as self and notice it in other people and how they speak. And then on top of all of this, try asking say an uncle or a neighbor what their thoughts are about ego and the gap variably shows up with people around us and this excused very important matter that shapes are everyday lives.</p>\n<p>So I will go on about ego but using the word self because I think it’s easier for people to see this clearly in this manner.  If we look around and take in how we are selfish about things when we are selfish about things and also consider there’s certain circumstances or state of mind that selfish actions are taken or thoughts or occur…  personally, as I’ve observed yesterday during a seemingly long day at work where I was very aware of being tired or basically exhausted, I experienced being triggered by lots of small things and I meditated on how it must be that my ego is showing up like my identity is showing up when I’m tired it takes over. It’s my autopilot. It’s my artificial intelligence that keeps me running when I’m too tired to really focus 100% on something for example and I start making mistakes. The ego shows up for me. My identity myself as upset. I recognize even in the moments that there’s a permission to quote” be upset and if I take a 40-year look at this back into my childhood and easily see that I had a often angry father who when things were not working or breaking down he would slam something or basically break something.</p>\n<p>As a child I had a lot of anger issues and often would punch walls and even in my thirties I can recount quite a few times when I had a reactive state when I was triggered by something and in that state had full permission to do something kind of very naughty. There is a sort of equilibrium to it in the moment so I do have some crack bones in my hands I’m sure from stupid incidents.</p>\n<p>But I imagine it’s true for everybody that when you’re tired or you’re feeling lazy, there is a certain flavor of selfishness in the moment that gives us permission to be less than positive. Let’s say.  Certainly laziness belongs to the world of self so does lying or holding out. All the tools for manipulation are related to the self and identity but we don’t consider life on a moment to moment basis. In this way we are often at the mercy of the waves crashing around us and creatures who are a product of them are environment 10,000 ft. View of this is the collective consciousness of human beings around the entire globe fluctuates in state and also maintains a consensus state behind middle ground of being selfish. That’s identity driven and egotistical that has our world seemingly on the brink of catastrophe.</p>\n<p>For human beings to shift this consensus of collective consciousness IE. Capitalism socialism popular ideologies that operate ferociously in the dark behind our own eyes.</p>\n<p>What’s acceptable as behavior on the individual level is also quite close to the collective belief of acceptable behavior.  Losing your temper is the same thing as going to war with another country.</p>\n<p>If human beings can speak about and have the ability to conversate about the self being selfish, how the ego works and identity, we have the possibility to really shift the course of humanity itself</p>\n<p>One way of what I’m suggesting is that there is one meditation happening throughout 8, 9, 10 billion people on this planet.</p>\n<p>So the daily meditation of watching oneself has become interesting and fruitful so that I make less mistakes or am aware of when I’m upset so that I don’t become so easily distracted and can focus.</p>\n<p>I like to watch the mind. Chatter I’ll just turn off the radio for an hour or two and be with all of the imagery and ideas and watch how my mind will drift into problem solving in different areas of my life, the sucking up energy of my brain.</p>\n<p>I keep coming back to being present to being none of the nonsense. None of the feelings. None of the tenseness in my muscles and I just relax as completely as possible and breathe.</p>\n<p>What’s happening in the mind is really the circus of self of our identity of our ideas of our beliefs of our conditioning.  None of the stuff happening in our heads is necessarily real or true, but it’s interesting to observe the difference of people who can see this and those who cannot and thus believe everything in their head. Those people I tend to see as being highly dramatic and spiritually. Poor people.</p>\n<p>I’ve mentioned before that there is no need to get rid of your ego. There is no need for a silly conversation about sitting still on a pillow closing your eyes holding a mudra though that does the same thing as any kind of authentic meditation.  I believe strongly that the ego is something to condition. It is a mental body so to speak that if we do not take care of it. It does not lead to a life of potential but rather a life of struggle and survival disconnection, anxiety, depression, conflict, more life produced by the mind like drunk driving through life.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ego 2","date":"January 22, 2022","description":"The Root of All Ego"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/ego-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ego 1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-second-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Himilayan Monocle"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9ab033e0-5c14-5baf-a048-71aa45177565","previousPostId":"60407b8d-dcfb-5243-811a-008b64a52262","nextPostId":"1c66d01e-ddd8-57cd-b613-1684c68c9574"}},
