I hope you had a great weekend and arrested for the week.</p>\n<p>Today I wanted to talk about how language affects performance in the workplace.</p>\n<p>By now everybody who speaks English is heard the phrase. Nobody wants to work anymore.</p>\n<p>It’s about as cliche as it is what it is.</p>\n<p>(How absurd? How judgmental and).</p>\n<p>I don’t know about you but I cringe when I hear these types of things.\nLook at who you’ve heard. Say these quips over the past year or two.\nHeck maybe your one as well.</p>\n<p>I’m willing to bet. Lol.</p>\n<p>So how does language have an effect on performance in the workplace?</p>\n<p>The first thing to notice is how we let statements like these above. Get baked into our heads.</p>\n<p>Like staring at a light bulb for a few minutes and then all you can see is this blacked out blur that takes 10 minutes to get rid of.</p>\n<p>Is there anything wrong with statements like these above?\nWell negative attitudes are very normalized and most workplace culture. And the effect of this on performance looks like dragging feet and poor communication, unusual and easily avoidable mistakes that cost time and money and strip morale from the daily ins and outs.</p>\n<p>Sure, maybe this seems like the cost of doing business.</p>\n<p>But like any organism in the wild, your best bet is to adapt or die.</p>\n<p>These times call for a new kind of leadership that most organizations don’t even know how to talk about.</p>\n<p>And so much of what I’m pointing at here has to do with communication.</p>\n<p>So whether or not you think it’s right or wrong to normalize statements like these above, just take into consideration that in a way the statements kill possibility.</p>\n<p>Their statements so loaded with bias and resignation. It’s like putting your flower in the microwave on high when you hear it everyday these statements.</p>\n<p>There’s certainly nothing wrong with venting, however, if you’re really committed to business growth and the ability to supercharge your people.</p>\n<p>Then I’ve got to tell you you’re going to need a new way to communicate.</p>\n<p>And it all starts with attitude.</p>\n<p>How you communicate as a leader dictates how your employees will communicate in general.</p>\n<p>This is usually in the conversation when I joke that there are no such thing as bad children or employees. There are only leaders and parents who need improvement. Lol.</p>\n<p>So I invite you to really listen to not what your teammates and employees say but how they say it. Don’t do anything more than that. Just listen. And consider that how communication is happening in your organization is literally sapping your profits.\nListen like a doctor for a heart. Palpitation.</p>\n<p>Listen like a startled mother hearing her child swear for the first time.</p>\n<p>And if you want to gain some serious mastery on how to drain the drama from your workplace then I recommend you sign up for my weekly email where I go into a deep dive with instructions on how to take this listening of language to another level.\nThere will certainly be a training available for this module of the honeymaker way as it is quite interactive and takes hours of practice.\nAgain, it’s like staring into a light bulb. It doesn’t take very long for this stuff to get baked into our heads. So that everywhere we go we see differently.\nAnd so.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"No One Wants to Work Anymore","date":"March 24, 2022","description":"'It Is What it Is'"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Keeping-the-Quitters/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Keeping the Quitters"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/run-your-business-like-a-cult/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Run Your Business like a Cult"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c2c924a5-3f3b-5228-8027-1564b7a288a6","previousPostId":"65a5da0e-a9cc-5395-828f-40d0738a8308","nextPostId":"9d37b7a3-0ae7-56ed-9696-d8ad4410b93d"}},
