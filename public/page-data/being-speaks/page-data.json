And I see how habit you make us complete zombies because well just thinking about an example like a sports player. They practice a physical routine and habit over and over and over and over. However, in the game if they were to simply perform as if they were in practice and let’s say in their head and just rigorously performing routines versus being in the game and being unchained or completely aware of using practice using habit and routine, but free from being happen free from habit containing your being and so with this looks like is Leonardo da Vinci completely aware and in action so that natural action occurs without effort. It occurs as genius to everyone else simply because we don’t live with a distinction between being habitual or habits containing our being versus being having habit</p>\n<p>Being speaks and being speaks not just like words like trees are a kind of being they don’t f****** talk to you but their natural action is the communication of our universe. The language that holds together the molecules of all the branches and the synergetic light stuff that I can only begin to scratch at holding the whole physical entity together. XYZ physics.</p>\n<p>Living a life completely ignorant of this phenomenon is really a life pointed towards cancer and disease and sour social life cycles that germinate fragmentation of the mind conflict and the whole suite of baked in human behaviors being judgmental, being nasty, etc.</p>\n<p>But a life lived. With this being imbued well I can only begin to speak about it. I would say many of the things that are possible today without this kind of awareness will persist and even flourish further than our current dreams.</p>\n<p>See when we’re living uncreatively we are living dormantly laying in wait, not an action beyond daily, weekly yearly habits and routines</p>\n<p>If you have ever wondered about taking this on for your own life to see what would happen and have come up against the fear that you are a whack job or a fake or a fraud or what right? Do you possibly have to live into a kind of inquiry that opens up ways of being around the worlds of language and physical reality?
