## How to turn your predicament into an opportunity

Over the past year, I’ve been taking notes on how the labor market has settled after Covid shut the world down.

The mystery of where did all the workers go has been confusing. Generally speaking, the government checks ran out a while ago so why aren’t there more people knocking on the door for a job?

I think a kind of matrix-like awakening happened for people around the world because of Covid. Billions of people were yanked out of their daily routines, then suddenly left with ample time and some with plenty of gov money to surf the web with ;)

With this shift, folks became super-empowered to live life the way they want. Living in a fancy sprinter van making six figures sounds irresistible, being a content producer or influencer, etc, is living a dream life. 

Workplace culture or work, in general, has/is still undergoing a counter-culture shift.

This doesn’t quite explain entirely why it’s so hard these days to get good help.

I think the elephant in the room in this matter has to do with Being of Service. 

There’s a bit of a financial conversation as well that I’ll jump on later.

But what I see as a huge missing, esp that of our younger generation of worker bees - is that Being of Service is a personally generated point of view and experience because they haven’t been taught or coached otherwise.

People are simply not excited to work. And they are more depressed than ever.

Being of Service improves people’s daily mood, their sense of connection, and integrity in what they do (in the workplace or home).

Your opportunity as a leader, small business owner, or whatever kind of big shot that you are - is to bake this into your operations.

Being of Service.

Not just Steps of service.

Not just a couple of poster printouts to hang in the office either.

You’ve gotta be able to teach and coach your people on this matter.

It’s your job to bring this to life. 

Further, I encourage you, dear reader, to consider that even your own sense of being of service could always use a tune-up.
