## How is the Great Resignation impacting your company today?

Are you able to at least keep up with customer demand?

Although, this isn’t a bad problem to have per se, you’ve gotta admit that it sucks not being able to grow or motivate your teams as you’d like.

Just like countless other small business owners and management ppl, you’re probably suffering from many of the day to day, and week-to-week issues that’s plaguing a whole generation of right now.

Quitters, lack of quality applications, mistakes on the job that end up costing more than money sometimes!

Listen, I get it. 

There’s only so much you and your team can do at the moment. 

Or, so you BELIEVE. 

But, what if I told you about how to catalyze your organizations’ growth in a way that you’ll never find in a book or a seminar or YouTube video?

Here, allow me pull back the curtain for you.

Today’s post is about creating beliefs and managing them for the purpose of propelling your business.

Let’s talk about running your business LIKE a CULT.

[ DUN DUN DUUUUUN ]

No, wait. I said LIKE a cult. Don’t get all wide eyed on me…

The word gets a bad rap. It’s just short for culture.

If you’re a hard-core sports fan, guess what? You, might be in a cult that believes so strongly in something you’re willing to actually fight.

Workplace culture runs on the same set of rules.

Let’s look at how this all happens in simple terms and how it applies to what you’re dealing with.

————————————————————————————————————————————————————

ALIGNMENT

Is everyone on your team(s) on the same page? 

See, most management tend to focus a lot on the routine stuff which is good and all but morale dies without a real sense of CRISIS.

This is one of the real secrets to motivating people. Politicians know this. Marketers know this. And now you do too!

Without mastering this toolset you can go ahead and keep herding cats in the dark my friend.

Or with some solid practice you can step into your power as a leader who inspires action.

BELONGING

Money motivates people to a LIMITED extent. After all, it’s easy to find another fire to put out at another company. Especially when everyone is desperately hiring like right now.

Why do so many bosses miss the boat when it comes to keeping talent long term?

Well, a couple things actually. 

If management wants turnover rates to drop like a sack of potatoes all they need to practice is deep acknowledgement upon their people for the efforts put forth. Even if its for small stuff. It shows you care and that they are not just a cog in the machine.

Further, run your cult-like business on the factor of employee-growth. Really. 

Figure out how to make your company a growth academy of some kind.

You’ll never have people breaking their backs for food and shelter ever again, you’ll have people breaking their backs to build a castle with joy.

COMMUNICATION

If people aren’t talking about the above two factors then they might as well not exist. Along with your potential business growth.

How you speak to your people is the glue that holds it all together, too.

Don’t think so much about talking to your teams to seem cool. Most of it is crap. I could tell you stories here…

To get better at communicating naturally, you’ve gotta master LISTENING.

If you don’t listen. So won’t your employees. Guaranteed.
