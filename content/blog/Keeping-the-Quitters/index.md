## Even if you'd rather let them go


Everybody knows someone who's a quitter.

Whether they've seen it at work as an employee or a boss.

Working in the restaurant industry in New York City. It was easy to spot those who are thinking about quitting for about to. Hell, they'd talk to anyone except management about leaving!

Personally, I have found it to be deeply frustrating when I have somebody on my team who quits or doesn't follow through on even a basic request.

The feeling of being left high and dry snubbed wondering how in the world the other person is justifying they're crapping out on you.

Quitters are the number one reason most ppl hate trying to put a team together for new projects.

Now that I think about it, it's not even just the quitters. It's the people who never follow through on even basic requests that leave us feeling resigned.





So what's the truth?

I've seen small business owners and management ignore the signs that folks are about to never show up again. 

What are the signs?
….

However, one of the surest warning signs that folks are packing their bags. Is the levels of drama or pretense between you and the other person or the person and the organization especially.

Active disengagement is basically pretending 9:00 to 5:00 

And shelling the performance with gossip circles and drama.

I found the mass majority of typical business leaders shelf this category of quitters because they don't know actually how to turn them around. In fact, they subconsciously believe or buy into the quitters belief so that there's just an air of resignation.

What's the old way? Next line…. Fine.

Ensure it's fine if you're a business


And sure, it's fine if you as a business leader are clear, it's okay to let somebody go because of XY and z. If you're like many small business leaders, turnover is expensive and inefficient, leaving your business and the difficult position to be competitive or really grow.

If you're like most business types, your experiencing touchy turnover issues and trouble attracting new blood.

So why isn't it in your best favor to be able to turn around the quitters and never follow through hers?

If you don't want to be an ordinary business leader who cuts their nose off spite their face, then I highly suggest you follow my recommendation below 

The factor that you can leverage to turn around this category of team member is communication.

Communication so that the other party feels safe and will be authentic. Even if they're so sure that they don't want to quit or follow through on a project because of other circumstances.

Communication butdtst the bubble of pretending.

And just in case it's not obvious yet, I'm not talking about chit chat. I'm talking about a structure for regularly checking in with people, especially if you don't have a lot of time to spend knowing what's going on and everybody's world with a 50 plus employee company.

My recommendation is to start practicing powerful check-in conversations.

Go be on. Simply asking how's it going or small talk?.

Improvise a short conversation that might last five to seven minutes tops.

Get curious about what's happening and their world.

Ask for feedback about their experience or ideas about day-to-day operations. For instance.

And before you leave the conversation and this is really important. While you're still present with the person. Listen for how to align what the person's dealing with with what your business stands for.

If you can, create a sense of opportunity with the other person before walking away.

And keep track on your own terms. What everybody is dealing with personally and how to keep a sense of opportunity alive with unique requests and powerful check-in conversations.

When an employee is an alignment with a business or organization, there is practically unlimited energy and focus. When there is a sense of belonging, an employee will be loyal and honest. And when there is powerful communication goals you never imagined will be possibly accomplished!!
